          Simply put: <strong>Making my life easier!</strong> <br />
          My job at the time required me to go through enormous amount of data to find patern in IT network logs. 
          This is when I was first introduce to it: <strong> PowerShell</strong>.

          Learning about powershell opened my horizon and from it emerged a new opportunity: <br />
          <strong>building an app that would help further streamline my workflow.</strong> <br />
          After a longer-than-needed brainstorming on the app name, I started building it from the ground up.
          React would serve the front end and to favourise integration with other tools, Python would serve the back end.

          One of the first tasks I wanted to simplify was upgrading customer's equipment.
          Hours of tedious logging to units, downloading configuration files and setting up FTP parameters.
          All of it is now done by the python server and updated information are rendered by react.
